     Uncomment the following to compile the widgetset for one browser only.
     This can reduce the GWT compilation time significantly when debugging.
     The line should be commented out before deployment to production
     environments.
      
     Multiple browsers can be specified for GWT 1.7 as a comma separated
     list. The supported user agents at the moment of writing were:
     ie6,ie8,gecko,gecko1_8,safari,opera
     
     The value gecko is used for Firefox 3 and later, gecko1_8 is for
     Firefox 2 and safari is used for  webkit based browsers including
     Google Chrome.
